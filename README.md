# Better-Chess-Ai

My second attempt at an AI that plays chess. Only 2 years after my previous attempt this program works infinitely better.

It uses an implementation of the negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning along with move ordering and multithreading which results in about ~4 seconds per move at a depth of 5 on my personal computer. It plays chess at around a 1200 elo rating which is funnily around my own level. Big thanks to the chess programming wiki for being a great resource to learn about this stuff: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page
